#Kickstarting with Excel

##Overview of Project
######The Kickstarter Challenge revolved around assisting Louise, an up and coming playwright, who’s fundraising for her play **Fever**. By reconfiguring her data, we were able to get a broad scope of the factors that contribute to the success, failure, or cancellation of a play.

###Purpose
######Utilizing excel functions such as pivot tables, pivot charts, filtering, statistics, and advanced excel formulas to scour through a large dataset. 

##Analysis and Challenges
######Deliverable one tested our knowledge of pivot tables and choice of graphing to portray campaign outcomes as either successful, failed, or canceled based on a launch date. Deliverable two involved us studying the relationship between the outcome and the initial goal and assessing what ranges of funding made for the likelihood of a play succeeding. 

###Analysis of 0utcomes Based on Launch Date
######This deliverable involved us extracting the year of the launches of the plays. We were then instructed to create a pivot table by placing the appropriate pivot tables fields in the columns, rows, and values. To ensure my table was identical to the table presented in the directions, I independently learned how to tweak the pivot tables to show only the months, and I also had to filter out the canceled column. 

###Analysis of 0utcomes Based on Goals
######I found the second deliverable to be the most challenging and I spent several hours working with ranges. I made some human errors along the way that were not hard to fix. What I found difficult was learning the pattern of the formula. Till I’m comfortable constructing a longer function, I found breaking up the filters was the easiest way to prevent errors and a great way to get acclimated with excel. 

###Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
######As someone who is not a seasoned excel user, I found many challenges along the way. We were introduced to new formulas that I’d never seen and I found =countif to be the most time consuming. However, spending a few hours recognizing the pattern of the formula really improved my understanding of the function and of Microsoft Excel overall. It’s not as scary as I thought.

##Results
######The data for Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date presented a fairly positive picture of the likelihood of a play thriving because more were successful than not. One conclusion I can make from the pivot chart and accompanying line chart is that plays are most successful when launched in late spring, early summer. Theater outcomes only begin to dip once the holidays and cold weather swings around. The data for Outcomes Based on Goals provides an interesting insight into what funding goal amount is optimal for the success of a play. With a considerable sample size, the data indicated plays with a funding goal of around $1,000-$10,000 had the most plays that stayed afloat. A limitation of the data that I encountered were that there were very few heavily funded plays in stark contrast to the lesser funded plays and is considerably an outlier if attempting to visualize what a realistic goal for a successful play should be.
